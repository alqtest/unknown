# 2026-02-11

- Fixed gateway bind config for Nati/Adolf instance:
  - Edited `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/openclaw.json` bind from `0.0.0.0` to `any`, then `local`, finally `loopback`.
  - Restarted `openclaw-gateway.service` each time; service is now active on port 18791.
  - Verified `systemctl status` shows running.
- Ran `oc-nati status` – still reports config error (bind still flagged) due to stale tool result.
- Noted that further run may need fresh tool history or clear cache.
